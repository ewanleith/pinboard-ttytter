Plugin for ttyter to let you add tweets to pinboard

Relies on the URI::Escape perl module, install it from CPAN using:

sudo cpan install URI::Escape 


Your Pinboard authentication details need to be stored in ~/.pinboard in the format of username:PINBOARD_API_KEY

Note, that's your pinboard API key, available in the Pinboard settings page, not your password!
