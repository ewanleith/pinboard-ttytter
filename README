Plugin for ttytter to let you add tweets to pinboard, by running the /pin command with a tweet ID, e.g.

c4> <user> This is a tweet test

/pin c4

Will add a new pinboard entry pointing at the original twitter URL for that tweet, with the description "This is a tweet test"

Relies on the URI::Escape perl module, install it from CPAN using:

sudo cpan install URI::Escape 


Your Pinboard authentication details need to be stored in ~/.pinboard in the format of username:PINBOARD_API_KEY

Note, that's your pinboard API key, available in the Pinboard settings page, not your password!

To execute on startup, run ttytter.pl with the exts flag set like:

ttytter.pl -exts=/path/to/pinboard.pl



This plugin is based on the Delicious extension to ttytter available here: https://www.reuteras.com/confluence/display/Projects/TTYtter+addons by Peter Reuteras
